Our communication is primarily handled through GitHub Issues.

## All General Inquiries (Bugs, Features, Discussions)

For nearly all topics related to the project—including **bug reports, feature requests, general questions, and discussions**—please use the **GitHub Issues** tracker.

The Discussions feature is currently disabled.
All discussions are managed in **GitHub Issues, where we use the `discussion` label**.
We will enable the Discussions tab if the need arises.
